# Zaalima-Telecome-Data-Analysis

# 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in a telecom company using data-driven insights. It explores customer behavior and patterns to identify why users leave the service. A Power BI dashboard and Python notebook are used for visualization and analysis. The goal is to enhance customer retention by understanding churn trends. The final output includes insights, recommendations, and future strategies.

# 🎯 Objective
The objective is to identify the key factors causing customer churn and help the company reduce churn rates. It also aims to segment high-risk customers and predict churn probability. Insights are used to support strategic decision-making.

# 🗂️ Dataset
- File Used: https://github.com/Utkarsh-2811/Zaalima-Telecome-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Telecom-Customer-Churn.csv

Details: The dataset contains information about customer demographics, account details, services subscribed (like internet, streaming, phone service), and whether the customer churned or not.

# 🔄 Steps & Workflow
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected data types, and encoded categorical variables.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used Python notebooks to visualize churn patterns, service usage, and customer demographics.

- Dashboard Creation: Created an interactive Power BI dashboard (https://github.com/Utkarsh-2811/Zaalima-Telecome-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Telecome.pbi) to visualize KPIs and trends.

- Modeling & Analysis: Applied statistical insights to find key correlations and churn-driving factors.

# 🔍 Key Findings & Insights
- Customers using month-to-month payment plans are more likely to churn.

- High churn is observed among fiber optic users and those without tech support or online backup.

- Tenure and total charges play a significant role; newer users churn more.

- Long-term contract customers (1–2 years) show lower churn rates.

# ✅ Recommendations
- Encourage long-term contracts with loyalty benefits.

- Offer bundled services or discounts for customers using only one service.

- Improve support experience, especially for tech and billing issues.

- Target high-risk customers early using churn prediction models.

# 🔭 Future Work
- Implement machine learning models for predictive churn detection.

- Personalize customer retention strategies based on churn likelihood.

- Automate alerts using Power BI to monitor churn-prone profiles.

- Integrate additional datasets like customer feedback or call logs.

# 📌 Conclusion
This project helps understand and reduce customer churn in the telecom sector. By analyzing behavior and service usage, key churn drivers were identified. The Power BI dashboard allows stakeholders to monitor churn risks visually. Insights from this project can improve retention strategies. Future enhancements will strengthen churn prediction and prevention.
