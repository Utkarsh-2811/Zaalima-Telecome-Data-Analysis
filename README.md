# Zaalima-Telecome-Data-Analysis

# 📌 Project Overview
This project explores customer churn in a telecom company using data analysis and visualization techniques. It combines a Power BI dashboard and Python-based data science methods to uncover key churn drivers and present actionable insights.

# 🎯 Objective
The main objective is to identify the reasons behind customer churn and help the telecom company reduce it by understanding patterns and trends in customer behavior.

# 🗂️ Dataset
- File Used: https://github.com/Utkarsh-2811/Zaalima-Telecome-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Telecom-Customer-Churn.csv

Details: The dataset contains information about customer demographics, account details, services subscribed (like internet, streaming, phone service), and whether the customer churned or not.

# 🔄 Steps & Workflow
- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected data types, and encoded categorical variables.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used Python notebooks to visualize churn patterns, service usage, and customer demographics.

- Dashboard Creation: Created an interactive Power BI dashboard (https://github.com/Utkarsh-2811/Zaalima-Telecome-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Telecome.pbi) to visualize KPIs and trends.

- Modeling & Analysis: Applied statistical insights to find key correlations and churn-driving factors.

# 🔍 Key Findings & Insights
- Customers using month-to-month payment plans are more likely to churn.

- High churn is observed among fiber optic users and those without tech support or online backup.

- Tenure and total charges play a significant role; newer users churn more.

- Long-term contract customers (1–2 years) show lower churn rates.

# ✅ Recommendations
- Encourage long-term contracts with loyalty benefits.

- Offer bundled services or discounts for customers using only one service.

- Improve support experience, especially for tech and billing issues.

- Target high-risk customers early using churn prediction models.

# 🔭 Future Work
- Implement machine learning models for predictive churn detection.

- Personalize customer retention strategies based on churn likelihood.

- Automate alerts using Power BI to monitor churn-prone profiles.

- Integrate additional datasets like customer feedback or call logs.

# 📌 Conclusion
This project effectively reveals actionable insights to reduce churn in the telecom sector. Through data analysis, visual storytelling, and strategic recommendations, it equips stakeholders to make informed decisions and improve customer retention.
